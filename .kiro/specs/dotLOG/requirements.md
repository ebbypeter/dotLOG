# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a VS Code extension called "dotLOG" that replicates Windows Notepad's .LOG functionality. When a file begins with ".LOG" as the first line, the extension automatically appends a timestamp each time the file is opened, allowing users to maintain chronological log entries. The extension supports text files (.txt), log files (.log), and markdown files (.md).

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to create auto-timestamped log files by typing ".LOG" as the first line, so that I can maintain chronological entries without manually adding timestamps.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user opens a file that starts with ".LOG" (case-sensitive, all caps) THEN the dotLOG extension SHALL automatically append the current date and time to the end of the file
2. WHEN the timestamp is added THEN the dotLOG extension SHALL position the cursor after the timestamp for immediate typing
3. WHEN a file does not start with ".LOG" THEN the dotLOG extension SHALL NOT modify the file content

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the dotLOG extension to work with multiple file types, so that I can use the .LOG feature across different kinds of files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a .txt file starts with ".LOG" THEN the dotLOG extension SHALL apply the auto-timestamp functionality
2. WHEN a .log file starts with ".LOG" THEN the dotLOG extension SHALL apply the auto-timestamp functionality  
3. WHEN a .md file starts with ".LOG" THEN the dotLOG extension SHALL apply the auto-timestamp functionality
4. WHEN a file has an unsupported extension THEN the dotLOG extension SHALL NOT apply the auto-timestamp functionality

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want timestamps to be formatted consistently and readably, so that my log entries are well-organized and easy to follow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a timestamp is added THEN it SHALL use the format "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM" (e.g., "2025-07-24 13:25")
2. WHEN a timestamp is added to a .txt or .log file THEN it SHALL be appended as plain text on a new line at the end of the file
3. WHEN a timestamp is added to a .md file THEN it SHALL be formatted as a heading 2 (##) followed by the timestamp
4. WHEN multiple timestamps are added THEN they SHALL maintain consistent formatting based on the file type
5. WHEN a timestamp is added THEN it SHALL include a line break after it to separate it from subsequent user input

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the dotLOG extension to handle edge cases gracefully, so that it works reliably in various scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a file contains only ".LOG" with no other content THEN the dotLOG extension SHALL still append the timestamp
2. WHEN a file already has existing content after ".LOG" THEN the dotLOG extension SHALL append the timestamp to the end without disrupting existing content
3. WHEN a file is opened multiple times in the same session THEN the dotLOG extension SHALL add a new timestamp each time
4. WHEN the file cannot be modified (read-only) THEN the dotLOG extension SHALL handle the error gracefully without crashing

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the dotLOG extension to be performant and non-intrusive, so that it doesn't negatively impact my VS Code experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a file is opened THEN the timestamp addition SHALL complete within 100ms
2. WHEN the dotLOG extension processes a file THEN it SHALL NOT block the VS Code interface
3. WHEN a file doesn't start with ".LOG" THEN the dotLOG extension SHALL have minimal performance impact
4. WHEN the dotLOG extension encounters an error THEN it SHALL log the error without displaying intrusive error messages to the user
